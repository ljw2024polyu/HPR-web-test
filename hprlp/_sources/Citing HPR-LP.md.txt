# Citing HPR-LP

If you use HPR-LP in your research, please star the project on [GitHub](https://github.com/PolyU-IOR/HPR-LP) and cite the following papers.

The first paper presents the GPU-based HPR-LP solver with adaptive restart and penalty updates, validated on large-scale benchmarks.
```bibtex
@article{chen2024hpr,
  author  = {Chen, Kaihuang and Sun, Defeng and Yuan, Yancheng and Zhang, Guojun and Zhao, Xinyuan},
  title   = {HPR-LP: An implementation of an HPR method for solving linear programming},
  journal = {Mathematical Programming Computation},
  year    = {2025}
}

```

The second paper develops accelerated variants of pADMM and proves $o(1/k)$ and $O(1/k)$ nonergodic convergence rates, supported by preliminary experiments.
