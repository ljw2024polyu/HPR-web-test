# Citing HPR-LP

If you use HPR-LP for published work, we encourage you to put a star on [Github](https://github.com/PolyU-IOR/HPR-LP) and cite the papers.

The first paper is a practical work, introducing an efficient GPU-based HPR-LP solver with adaptive restart and penalty updates, validated through large-scale experiments.

The second paper is a theoretical study, developing accelerated variants of pADMM and proving o(1/k) and O(1/k) nonergodic convergence rates, supported by preliminary experiments.
