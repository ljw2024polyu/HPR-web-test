# Julia interfaces

This page shows how to use the **Julia interface** of HPR-LP: run demos, build custom problems, adjust solver settings, and interpret results.

---


## Usage 1: Run LP instances in MPS format

### Setting Data and Result Paths
Before running the scripts, please modify `run_single_file.jl` or `run_dataset.jl` in the scripts directory to specify the data path and result path according to your setup.

### Running a Single Instance
To test the script on a single instance (`.mps` file):

```bash
julia --project scripts/run_single_file.jl
```

### Running All Instances in a Directory
To process all `.mps` files in a directory:

```bash
julia --project scripts/run_dataset.jl
```

## Usage 2: Define Your LP Model in Julia Scripts

### Example 1: Build and Export an LP Model Using JuMP

This example shows how to build an LP model in JuMP, export it to MPS format, and solve it with HPR-LP.

```bash
julia --project demo/demo_JuMP.jl
```

The script:

- Builds a linear programming (LP) model.  
- Saves the model as an MPS file.  
- Uses HPR-LP to solve the LP instance.  

> **Tip:** If the model may be infeasible or unbounded, you can use HiGHS to check it.

```julia
using JuMP, HiGHS
## read a model from file (or create in other ways)
mps_file_path = "xxx" # your file path
model = read_from_file(mps_file_path)
## set HiGHS as the optimizer
set_optimizer(model, HiGHS.Optimizer)
## solve it
optimize!(model)
```

### Example 2: Define LP instance Directly in Julia

This example shows how to construct and solve a linear programming problem directly in Julia without relying on JuMP.

```bash
julia --project demo/demo_Abc.jl
```

The small LP instance demo_Abc is given by

```{math}
\begin{aligned}
\min_{x_1, x_2} \quad & -3x_1 - 5x_2 \\
\text{s.t.} \quad 
& -x_1 - 2x_2 \;\ge -10, \\
& -3x_1 - x_2 \;\ge -12, \\
& x_1 \ge 0, \; x_2 \ge 0.
\end{aligned}
```

## Note on First-Time Execution Performance

The first run of an instance may feel slow because Julia compiles code on the first execution (JIT compilation).


```{tip}
**Tip for Better Performance:**  
To reduce repeated compilation overhead, it’s recommended to run scripts from an **IDE like VS Code** or the **Julia REPL** in the terminal.
```

**Start Julia REPL with the project environment**

```bash
julia --project
```

Then, at the Julia REPL, run `demo/demo_Abc.jl` (or other scripts):

```julia
include("demo/demo_Abc.jl")
```

```{admonition} CAUTION
If you encounter the error message:

`Error: Error during loading of extension AtomixCUDAExt of Atomix, use Base.retry_load_extensions() to retry`.

This is usually temporary. Wait a few moments and the extension will load automatically.
```

# Example from /demo/demo_Abc.jl
println("Objective value: ", result.primal_obj)
println("x1 = ", result.x[1])
println("x2 = ", result.x[2])
```
